Create collection containing default directives (with default parameters):

"LDL\Env\Util\Compiler\Directive\EnvSkipEmptyCompilerDirective"
"LDL\Env\Util\Compiler\Directive\EnvVarCaseTransformCompilerDirective"
"LDL\Env\Util\Compiler\Directive\EnvIgnoreLineCompilerDirective"
"LDL\Env\Util\Compiler\Directive\EnvIgnoreCommentsCompilerDirective"
"LDL\Env\Util\Compiler\Directive\EnvDuplicateVarResolverCompilerDirective"
"LDL\Env\Util\Compiler\Directive\EnvUnknownLineCompilerDirective"

Create a string from the previous collection of directives:

"LDL\Env\Util\Line\Type\Directive\EnvLineDirective"

Print the directive:

"!LDL-COMPILER START={"SKIP_EMPTY":true,"VAR_NAME_CASE":null,"IGNORE":false,"COMMENTS":false,"ONDUPLICATEVAR":"throw","ONUNKNOWLINE":"discard"}"
Obtain available directives from directive as objects:

Remove first directive (Skip empty):

Recreate directive and dump as string, as we removed the first directive, skip empty must not be present
"!LDL-COMPILER START={"VAR_NAME_CASE":null,"IGNORE":false,"COMMENTS":false,"ONDUPLICATEVAR":"throw","ONUNKNOWLINE":"discard"}"
